[Instruction of the "ViewCart" page]

For the "ViewCart" page, it is in progress of creating the corresponding interface of the user's selection of products (part B). Therefore, if you directly access the page, the current layout is not what I intended to show. Please view the layout of this page after you add some items in the cart. Then the layout should be identical with my design and the static version except the information is corresponsive to your selection from the product page.

I am sorry for the inconvenience. I also have the original static HTML file. If you prefer to see that, I am happy to quickly link it back to my page. Currently, it is saved as a separate HTML file called "ViewCart2.html".
