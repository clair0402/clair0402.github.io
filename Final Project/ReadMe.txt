******Interaction Instruction******
The website uses many scroll magic, so please scroll slowly to view all the content.

******For Folder Organization******
This project uses the Vega-Lite API which doesn't allow the javascript files to be properly linked with the CSV and HTML files. I have done a lot of research on solving the problem and the only way to make the website works properly is to host the HTML Files in the largest folder which means I can't group them under the "HTML" folder. To show that I understood how to organize files, I have organized the "home.html" under the "HTML" folder and all the other files under each of their folders under "Assets". If you want me to explain more about the connection issue, feel free to reach out!
